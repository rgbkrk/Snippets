# Snippet UI Take Home Assignment

## Overview

The Snippet UI consists of an input and output area. The input area contains a code editor which accepts javascript code. The output area needs to display the result of the evaluated code in the code editor, e.g. see below. The goal of this activity is to hook up the `Run` button so that the results of the evaluated code appear in the output area.
